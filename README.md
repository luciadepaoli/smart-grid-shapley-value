# Two-steps Shapley value computation for Smart Grid management
Project for Game Theory course at University of Padua.

We investigate the application of a 2-steps Shapley value in a Smart Grid in order to establish the trading price and to evaluate the total gain/cost for prosumers. A simulation is provided.
